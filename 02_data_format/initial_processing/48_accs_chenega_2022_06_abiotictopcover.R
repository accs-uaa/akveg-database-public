# "Format Abiotic Top Cover Table for ACCS Chenega Data"
# Author: Amanda Droghini, Alaska Center for Conservation Science
# Last Updated: 2025-03-26
# Usage: Must be executed in R version 4.4.3+.
# Description: "Format Abiotic Top Cover Table for ACCS Chenega Data" formats abiotic top cover data collected and entered by ACCS for ingestion into the AKVEG Database. The script ensures values match constrained values, adds missing abiotic elements, and ensures values are within reasonable range. The output is a CSV table that can be converted and included in a SQL INSERT statement.
