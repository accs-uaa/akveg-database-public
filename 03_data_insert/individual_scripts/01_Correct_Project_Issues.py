# Description: "Perform QC checks for Project table" queries the AKVEG database to identify
# data entry errors in the Project table of the AKVEG Database. The output is a CSV file that lists site codes that
# should be dropped from the database because they are lacking cover data or because their coordinate or date values
# are out of bounds.
